# Preprocessing

In this folder, we have the preprocessing steps to generate the data necessary to perform our experiments.
We have three subfolders, one for each experiment.

- multi\_reference\_constraint: scripts for the generation of En source plus constraints from multi references.
- rare\_terms\_as\_constraints: scripts to download terms and find EuroParl sentences containing such terms.
- single\_reference\_constraint: scripts for the generation of En source sentences plus constraints from a single reference.
- lemmatize.sh: script to lemmatize the dataset using UDPipe.
